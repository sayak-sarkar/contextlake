# Changelog

All notable changes to gitlab_sync will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Incremental workspace indexing**: `index --workspace` now re-indexes only the
  repos whose git HEAD moved since their last index (skipping unchanged ones), with
  `--force` to rebuild everything. Paired with cron this gives scheduled
  incremental refresh.
- **`lint` command** for the knowledge layer: reports graph-health issues — repos
  gone stale (HEAD moved since index) and dangling edges (an endpoint node missing
  from the store).
- **Colorful CLI**: status glyphs, coloured per-repo lines, and a progress bar for
  the sync and knowledge-layer commands. Honors `NO_COLOR`/`FORCE_COLOR` and falls
  back to plain text off a TTY (pipes, cron, and logs stay clean). No new
  dependencies.

## [1.7.0] - 2026-06-21

### Added

- **Hybrid retrieval** (`hybrid_search` MCP tool): seeds Personalized PageRank with
  the embedding hits and propagates relevance across the graph (HippoRAG-style), so
  structurally-related nodes (callers, dependents) surface even when their text does
  not match the query. PPR runs over a BFS-bounded subgraph to stay tractable.
- **Optional sqlite-vec ANN backend** for the vector store, selectable via
  `[embeddings] vector_backend` (`auto` | `sqlite-vec` | `brute`). `auto` uses
  sqlite-vec when the `gitlab-sync[kb-vec]` extra is installed and falls back to the
  exact pure-Python cosine scan otherwise — same interface either way.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-06-21

### Added

- **Semantic-search tier (optional, local-first)**: a pluggable embeddings
  provider (`Embedder` interface + config-driven factory; a stdlib-only Ollama
  provider ships first), a local SQLite-backed vector store with cosine search, an
  `embed` command that vectorizes indexed nodes, and a `semantic_search` MCP tool
  exposed by `serve` when embeddings are enabled. Off by default; `doctor` reports
  embeddings status.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-06-21

### Added

- **Figma knowledge connector**: links repos to the design files they reference,
  classifying `figma.com` URLs (file/design/proto/board) to a stable file key and
  taking the human file name from the URL slug. When a Figma MCP is configured each
  design is additionally checked for reachability (best-effort, never required).
  Runs alongside Atlassian sources under `connect`. Connector-agnostic helpers were
  extracted to a shared module so new connectors stay small.

### Fixed

- `link_scrape` association rules expressed as a `patterns` list (as in the example
  config) were silently ignored; both a singular `pattern` and a `patterns` list
  are now honored.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-06-21

Adds an optional **knowledge layer** (`gitlab_sync.kb`, the `[kb]` extra,
Python ≥ 3.10) that turns the mirrored repositories into a queryable knowledge
graph served to AI agents over MCP. The core sync tool is unchanged and the extra
is entirely opt-in. Everything is generic and config-driven — no
organization-specific data lives in the package.

### Added

- **Knowledge-graph store and CLI**: `index`, `query`, `serve`, and `doctor`
  commands backed by a SQLite + FTS5 cross-repo index with per-repo JSON shards.
  Every node/edge is provenance-stamped (source file + verified date) and
  confidence-tagged (`EXTRACTED` / `INFERRED` / `AMBIGUOUS`).
- **Code graph** via tree-sitter for Python, JavaScript, TypeScript/TSX, and C#:
  files, classes, functions/methods, interfaces, imports, containment, and an
  intra-repo **call graph** (the parser registry is pluggable). `index --workspace`
  indexes every git repository under a directory.
- **Cross-repo dependency graph** from `pyproject.toml`, `package.json`, and
  `*.csproj` manifests through shared package nodes.
- **MCP server** (stdio or streamable-http) exposing `search_code`,
  `find_definition`, `find_callers`, `find_dependents`, `get_neighbors`,
  `shortest_path`, and `graph_stats`, plus a `kb://stats` resource. All output is
  sanitized before it reaches an agent.
- **Knowledge connectors** (`connect`): an **Atlassian** connector links each repo
  to the Jira issues and Confluence pages it references. Candidate issue keys
  (from branch/commit names) are confirmed and enriched against live sites with a
  single batched JQL call (unverified false-positives are dropped); Atlassian URLs
  in docs are classified into issue/page links. One or more sites are supported,
  each independently authenticated over MCP. Output is stored in an isolated graph
  partition so code re-indexing never disturbs external links.
- **Config** (`examples/kb.toml.example` → `~/.gitlab-sync/kb.toml`): store
  location, languages, knowledge sources, and association rules — all
  organization-specific facts live here, never in the package.
- CI now runs a separate knowledge-layer job (Python 3.10-3.13) alongside the
  core job, including a genericity guard that fails the build if organization data
  appears in the source.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-06-21

This release stabilizes the core and makes the tool installable. It repairs
several regressions introduced by the earlier modularization and fixes a
critical configuration bug.

### Fixed

- **Critical:** repositories were keyed by their full `<group>/...` path while
  local clones mirror the tree *below* the group, so every repo was misreported
  as missing-and-extra and a sync would clone duplicates into a bogus `<group>/`
  subtree. Paths are now mapped to their group-relative local form (the full
  path is retained for `glab` authentication).
- **Critical:** a `~` (or `$VAR`) in a config-file `work_dir`/`cache_dir` was
  treated literally, so the tool operated on a non-existent path and saw zero
  local repositories. Path values are now expanded.
- **Critical:** boolean config settings (`protect_working_branches`,
  `require_clean_workspace`, `clean_corrupted`, `adaptive_workers`,
  `auto_stash`) were silently overridden by CLI defaults on every run, which
  disabled branch protection and the clean-workspace requirement by default.
  Flags now default to "unset" so config-file values are honoured.
- `--config` was accepted but ignored; the explicit config path is now loaded.
- Config precedence corrected to: explicit `--config` > local > global > defaults
  (previously global silently overrode local).
- `AdaptiveWorkerPool` raised `AttributeError` / never actually resized the pool;
  it now initializes correctly and parallelism adapts to the live error rate.
- Retry/backoff existed but was never wired in; clone now retries transient
  failures (network/timeout) and fails fast on DNS/TLS.
- `update` reported failed `git pull` (conflicts, auth, network) as
  "Already up to date"; it now distinguishes updated / unchanged / error by
  comparing HEAD before and after.
- `load` silently discarded a list-shaped JSON cache; it is now normalized.
- `fetch` used a malformed `glab` invocation; it now calls the GitLab API with a
  URL-encoded group path and correct pagination, and restores the
  `path|ssh|http|default_branch|archived` text cache.
- `verify` recovers nested-repository (repo-inside-repo) detection.
- Corrupted (non-git) target directories are detected and re-cloned again
  (honouring `--clean-corrupted`); cloning prefers `glab` for authentication.

### Added

- Installable package with a `gitlab-sync` console entry point, `python -m
  gitlab_sync`, and the bare `python3 gitlab_sync.py` script (src layout).
- `--dry-run` to preview clone/update/branch actions without changing anything.
- Logging via the standard library with `-v/--verbose`, `-q/--quiet`, and
  `--log-file` (rotating audit log).
- `clone_method` (auto|glab|git) and `branch_strategy` (commits|recency|hybrid)
  configuration; the most-active-branch heuristic is now recency-aware.
- `--version` flag.
- A pytest test suite (68 tests) with fakes for `git`/`glab`, and GitHub Actions
  CI running ruff + pytest on Python 3.9-3.14.
